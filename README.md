# Original Mixer
Have you ever had this problem? ![](https://image.prntscr.com/image/1FGjWnUmSrWTR2iZNcbqFQ.jpeg)

When I liked a song I heard on a radio show, I added it to my saved songs -- but I added the version with all the talking!
Trying to find the original mixes of all of those songs would take like an hour of mindless searching and comparing...

So instead I made this basic app with the Spotify Web Client API to find extended and original mixes of all the tracks in my saved library.
Now I can freely add songs to my saved library without having to worry about finding the originals later!

Included with the mixer web app is:
- A playlist browser including your saved tracks list
- Track listing for the selected playlist including links to (when available) both radio and extended mixes of all the songs
- Batch track extending for the entire playlist
- Ability to create a new playlist with the extended songs (in the same order) or
- Ability to overwrite your existing playlist with the extended songs (in the same order)

Disclaimer: This is still a work in progress. I recommend you create a new playlist instead of overwriting your existing playlist,
just in case the mixer runs into any issues.
